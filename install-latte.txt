Copy this entire line and paste into Standard Notes → Extensions → Import Extension:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkeerthivikram/sn-catppuccin/main/latte/ext.json

If that doesn't work, try:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkeerthivikram/sn-catppuccin/main/catppuccin-latte.json

If that doesn't work, try the CSS directly:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkeerthivikram/sn-catppuccin/main/latte/dist/css/theme.css

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Make sure you're logged into Standard Notes
2. Try clearing Standard Notes cache (close and reopen)
3. Check if you have any extensions blocked
4. Try importing in Standard Notes web app instead of desktop
